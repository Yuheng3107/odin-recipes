# odin-recipes
This is a mini project that involves making a website that displays recipes for 3 different dishes.

In this project, the use of anchor tags to have hyperlinks, the use of image tags to embed images, as well as the use of various other HTML tags allows me to display a basic level of proficiency in HTML.
